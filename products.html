<p>For those who are new to the natural hair community, knowing where to start can be overwhelming. One good place to start is to learn or determine your hair type or rather texture. Hair type refers to the shape of the hair strands. While not scientific, hair typing provides a guide by which individuals can understand their hair in terms of how best to achieve desired styles and create a good hair care routine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	  
<p>Hair typing is typically broken down into four groups. This system is based on categories as determined by the curl pattern of the hair, with each category having a range from A to C. So in theory there would be a total of twelve different hair types that your hair could be classified under. The first category would be classified as Type 1 for people with completely straight to minimally wavy hair. The next category would be Type 2. These individuals would have a slight wave to loose curl to their hair. Type 3 people have loose curls and up to spiral-shaped curls. And finally Type 4 people have tighter curls, some in the shape of smaller tight coils, some even have a z shape curl pattern or ringlets.</p>
