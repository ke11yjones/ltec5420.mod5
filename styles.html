	<h1>A Matter of Style &nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
		&nbsp;
<p>Regardless of the location, all hair begins the same way. Hair growth starts in the dermis layer of the skin. This layer is below the epidermis which is the layer that we can see. The dermis layer is thicker than the epidermis and has all of oil and sweat glands, hair follicles, connective tissues, nerve endings, and lymph vessels (Watson, 2018). Hair growth begins in the Anagen phase, which lasts for approximately 4 to 6 years for hair growing from the scalp. It is during the Anagen phase that the hair actually grows. Basically, hair is created by protein cells in the hair bulb which is located at the base of the hair follicle. Throughout this phase the hair grows up though the follicle and becomes visible from the epidermis, the visible part of the hair is called the shaft. During this phase scalp hair grows at a rate of about 1cm every 28 days (WebMD 2010). Once the hair reaches the end of the Anagen phase it transitions to the next phase in the growth cycle.</p>
