<h1>Black Hair by the Numbers</h1>
	  
	  

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Natural Hair market has seen a constant and impressive increase over the past decade. Thanks in part to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the impact of social media</li>
	<li>celebrity trends</li>   	
    <li>knowledgeable consumer base </li>
</ul>
<p>who are not only concerned with what makes their hair look good, but also what is actually good for the overall health of their hair, natural hair products have exploded the market faster than any other segment in the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	  
<p>According to NielsenIQ Omnishopper, as of the end of April 2022 Black consumers were responsible for $7.42B in cosmetic and skin care sales with $2.2B alone going to haircare. Yet, Black communities are still under-served in the traditional marketplace. To bridge the gap between what is desired (more all-natural products with fewer sulfates and parabens) and what is available, a new breed of entrepreneur is entering the marketplace. Each year we are seeing a rise in consumer-turned-developer. These are people, who out of their own need for something different, set out to create products to address their own specific haircare needs, and in-turn gave birth to multi-million dollar haircare brands that cater specifically to black natural hair.</p>
